Usage
Data Processing Pipeline

Extract Audio Segments: Run the extract_segments.py script to extract audio segments from raw recordings:

bashpython extract_segments.py

Spectral Clustering Methodology
The spectral clustering implementation follows a four-step process:

Similarity Matrix Construction: Uses Gaussian kernel to compute pairwise similarities between autoencoder features
Laplacian Matrix Computation: Constructs the normalized graph Laplacian from the similarity matrix
Eigenvector Computation: Finds the k smallest eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix
K-means Clustering: Applies K-means algorithm to the eigenvector matrix to obtain final cluster assignments

Current Results
Latest clustering run identified 5 distinct clusters from 710 Bryde's whale call segments:

Silhouette Score: 0.29 (indicating moderately well-separated clusters)
Cluster Distribution:

Cluster 0: 164 samples (23.1%)
Cluster 1: 38 samples (5.4%) - smallest cluster
Cluster 2: 187 samples (26.3%)
Cluster 3: 97 samples (13.7%)
Cluster 4: 224 samples (31.5%) - largest cluster



The enhanced spectrogram generation (75Ã—47 resolution) provides improved frequency resolution and contrast, better capturing the harmonic structure of Bryde's whale calls compared to the initial implementation.
Cluster Evaluation Workflow
After running spectral clustering, use the evaluation tools to validate results:

Visual Comparison: Open cluster_comparison.png to see representative spectrograms from each cluster
Audio Evaluation: Use the .m3u playlist files to listen to samples from each cluster
Detailed Analysis: Browse individual cluster folders to examine specific samples
Statistical Review: Check cluster_statistics.csv for quantitative analysis

Key Improvements in Current Version

Enhanced Spectrogram Generation: Optimized parameters for whale bioacoustics (1024 FFT size, 64 hop length)
Better Frequency Resolution: Focused on 10-600 Hz range where whale calls occur
Multiple Spectrogram Versions: Original, denoised, and enhanced versions for comparison
Improved Time Resolution: 47 time bins vs 8 in initial version
Adaptive Denoising: Spectral subtraction based on estimated noise floor

This unsupervised approach successfully discovered distinct acoustic patterns in Bryde's whale calls without requiring labeled training data, providing insights into the natural vocal repertoire of this species.
